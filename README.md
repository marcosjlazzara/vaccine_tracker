# Vaccine tracker

A global vaccine tracker that provides comprehensive insights into vaccination progress from 24th January 2020 until 3rd March 2024, displaying data on partial and full vaccination rates, as well as unvaccinated populations. 

In the context of global health, real-time data on vaccination rates are crucial for effective public health management and epidemic prevention. Recognising the need for an accessible, accurate, and comprehensive visualisation of vaccination data, a global vaccine tracker has been developed using Tableau. This was designed to assist policymakers, health professionals, and researchers by providing up-to-date information on vaccination progress across various demographics and regions.

Development Process
The development of the vaccine tracker involved several phases, starting with the aggregation of global vaccination data from multiple international health databases. This data encompasses metrics on individuals who are partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and not vaccinated. Datasets were manipulated using SQL due the vast amount of data in relation with this topic. 


The dashboard is equipped with a variety of features that enhance its utility and user-friendliness:

 - Vaccination Status Metrics: It displays data on people who are partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and not vaccinated, offering a clear view of vaccination coverage.

 - Geographical Filtering: Users can drill down the data by country, location, or continent, making it possible to analyse regional variations in vaccination rates.

- Temporal Analysis: The dashboard allows users to select specific date ranges, facilitating the examination of vaccination trends over time.

 - Socioeconomic Correlations: A unique feature of the dashboard is its ability to correlate vaccination rates per hundred people with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of each region, highlighting the relationship between economic status and vaccination uptake.

- Interactive Mapping: A dynamic map displays the percentage of the vaccination data requested, providing a visual representation of global vaccination coverage that is both comprehensive and easy to interpret.


Applications and Benefits
The global vaccine tracker serves multiple stakeholders in various capacities:

 - Public Health Officials can monitor vaccination progress and identify regions with lagging vaccination rates, enabling targeted immunisation campaigns.

 - Researchers benefit from the ability to perform detailed analyses of vaccination data against economic indicators, aiding in the study of factors influencing vaccination acceptance.

 - Policy Makers can use the data to allocate resources more effectively, ensuring that vaccination efforts are optimised according to regional needs.
